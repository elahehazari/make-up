    <p>Cosmetics are care substances used to enhance the appearance or odor of the human body. They are generally
        mixtures of
        chemical <span>compounds</span>,some being derived from natural sources, many being synthetic.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="boldOne">The word cosmetics derives from the Greek κοσμητική τέχνη (kosmetikē
        tekhnē), meaning "technique of dress and
        ornament",
        from κοσμητικός (kosmētikos), "skilled in ordering or arranging" and that from κόσμος (kosmos), meaning amongst
        others
        "order" and "ornament".
    </p>
    <br>
    <div id="paragragh1">Archaeological evidence of cosmetics dates at least from ancient Egypt and Greece. According to
        one source, early
        major
        developments include:</div>

    <p> Castor oil used by ancient Egypt as a protective balm.</p>

    <P class="boldOne">Skin creams made of beeswax,</P>

    <p id="paragragh2">olive oil, and rosewater, described by Romans.</p>

    <P>Vaseline and lanolin in the nineteenth century.</P>

    <p class="boldOne"> Nivea Creme in 1911</p>

    <p>The Ancient Greeks also used cosmetics. Cosmetics are mentioned in the Old Testament, such as in 2 Kings 9:30,
        where
        Jezebel painted her eyelids—approximately 840 BC—and in the book of Esther, where various beauty treatments are
        described.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Cosmetic use was frowned upon at many points in Western history. For example, in the 19th century, Queen Victoria
        publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar, and acceptable only for use by actors</p>
    <br>
    <p>Of the major cosmetics firms, the largest is L'Oréal, which was founded by Eugene Schueller in 1909 as the French
        Harmless Hair Colouring Company (now owned by Liliane Bettencourt 26% and Nestlé 28%; the remaining 46% is
        traded publicly). The market was developed in the USA during the 1910s by Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein,
        and Max Factor. These firms were joined by Revlon just before World War II and Estée Lauder just after.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Beauty products are now widely available from dedicated internet-only retailers, who have more recently been
        joined
        online by established outlets, including the major department stores and traditional bricks and mortar beauty
        retailers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Although modern make-up has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of males are gradually
        using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features. Concealer is commonly
        used by cosmetic-conscious men. Cosmetics brands release cosmetic products especially tailored for men, and men
        are increasingly using such products.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Makeup types</h1>
    <p>Cosmetics include skin-care creams, lotions, powders, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail and toe nail polish, eye
        and
        facial makeup, towelettes, permanent waves, colored contact lenses, hair colors, hair sprays and gels,
        deodorants, hand
        sanitizer, baby products, bath oils, bubble baths, bath salts, butters and many other types of products. A
        subset of
        cosmetics is called "make-up," which refers primarily to coloring products intended to alter the user’s
        appearance.
        manufacturers distinguish between decorative cosmetics and care cosmetics.</p>
    <p>
        Most cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Primer,</strong>comes in various formulas to suit individual skin conditions. Most are meant to
            reduce the appearance of pore size,
            prolong the wear of makeup, and allow for a smoother application of makeup, and are applied before
            foundation.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Lipgloss,</strong>is a sheer, liquid form of lipstick. Lipstick, lip gloss, lip liner, lip plumper,
            lip balm, lip conditioner, lip primer,
            and lip boosters. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on
            the lips. The
            idea behind lip stains is to temporarily saturate the lips with a dye, rather than to cover them with a
            colored wax.
            Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator brush or be applied with a
            finger.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Concealer,</strong>makeup used to cover any imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for
            any extra coverage needed to cover
            blemishes or other marks. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer
            lasting, more
            detailed coverage. Some formulations are meant only for the eye or only for the face.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Foundation,</strong>is used to smooth out the face and cover spots or uneven skin coloration.
            Usually a liquid, cream, or powder, as well as most recently a light and fluffy mousse, foundation also
            provides excellent coverage. Foundation primer can be applied before or after foundation to obtain a
            smoother finish. Some primers come in powder or liquid form to be applied before foundation as a base, while
            other primers come as a spray to be applied after the foundation to help the make-up last longer.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Face powder,</strong>is used to set the foundation, giving it a matte finish, and also to conceal
            small flaws or blemishes.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Rouge,</strong>blush or blusher is cheek coloring used to bring out the color in the cheeks and make
            the cheekbones appear more
            defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Contour powder/creams,</strong>are used to define the face. They can be used to give the illusion of
            a slimmer face or to modify a person’s face shape
            in other desired ways. Usually a few shades darker than one's own skin tone and matte in finish, contour
            products create
            the illusion of depth. A darker toned foundation/concealer can be used instead of contour products for a
            more natural
            look.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Highlight,</strong>used to draw attention to the high points of the face as well as to add glow to
            the face, comes in liquid, cream, and
            powder forms. It often contains shimmer, but sometimes does not. A lighter toned foundation/concealer can be
            used
            instead of highlight to create a more natural look.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Bronzer</strong>, is used to give skin a bit of color by adding a golden or bronze glow. It comes in
            either matte, semi matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Mascara,</strong>is used to darken, lengthen, and thicken the eyelashes. It is available in natural
            colors such as brown and black, but
            also comes in bolder colors such as blue, pink, or purple. There are many different formulas, including
            waterproof
            versions for those prone to allergies or sudden tears. It is often used after an eyelash curler and mascara
            primer. Many
            mascaras now have certain components intended to help lashes to grow longer and thicker.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Eyelash glue,</strong>is used to adhere false lashes to the eyes. It comes in either clear or
            colored formulas.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Eyebrow pencils,</strong>creams, waxes, gels and powders are used to color and define the brows.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Nail polish,</strong>is used to color the fingernails and toenails.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Setting Spray,</strong>is used to keep applied makeup intact for long periods of time. An
            alternative to setting spray is setting powder, which
            may be either pigmented or translucent. Cosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the
            product.
            Cosmetics can be liquid or cream emulsions; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and anhydrous
            creams or
            sticks.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Eyeliner</strong>is used to enhance and elongate the size of the eye.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Makeup remover,</strong>is a product used to remove the makeup products applied on the skin. It is
            used to clean the skin before other
            procedures, like applying bedtime lotion.</li>
        <br>

    <h1>Skin types</h1>
    <img src="/img makeup/e84jz5095b61c95c087d7179076242_720x720.jpg">
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Normal skin</strong> This type of skin has a fine, even and smooth surface due to its ideal balance
            between oil and moisture
            content and is
            therefore neither greasy nor dry. People who have normal skin have small, barely-visible pores. Thus, their
            skin usually
            appears clear and does not frequently develop spots and blemishes. This type of skin needs minimal and
            gentle treatment,
            but does still require maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry skin</strong>Dry skin has a parched appearance and tends to flake easily. It is prone to
            wrinkles and lines due to its
            inability to
            retain moisture, as well as an inadequate production of sebum by sebaceous glands. Dry skin often has
            problems in cold
            weather, which dries it out even further. Constant protection in the form of a moisturizer by day and a
            moisture-rich
            cream by night is essential. It is important not to over-exfoliate even in cases of extreme flaking, as this
            only dries
            out the skin further; gentle exfoliants using sugar, rice bran or mild acids are the most suitable, although
            they should
            not be used more frequently than once per week to avoid causing irritation and dryness.</li>
        <li><strong>Oily skin/strong</strong>As its name implies, this type of skin surface is slightly to moderately
            greasy, which is caused by the over
            secretion
            of sebum. The excess oil on the surface of the skin causes dirt and dust from the environment to adhere to
            it. Oily skin
            is usually prone to blackheads, whiteheads, spots and pimples. It needs to be cleansed thoroughly every day,
            especially
            in hot or humid weather. Moisturizing with an oil-free, water-based and non-comedogenic moisturizer is
            required in
            addition. Exfoliation is also necessary, but over-exfoliation can cause irritation and increase in oil
            production;
            exfoliants that contain fruit acids are particularly helpful, and fine-grained exfoliants may help to clear
            blocked
            pores, discouraging breakouts and improving the skin's appearance.</li>
